_Configuration_

The file *lifebarrc.example* is well annotated and contains all the available
configuration options. Configuration files should be saved/linked
to *~/.lifebarrc* to be read by lifebar.

_Features_

Transparency - all colour settings allow for full RGBA colour selection,
including the main background area.

All the major components you expect from a workspace bar are included, such as
network interface monitoring, filesystem capacity, cpu and ram usage etc.
Lifebar also supports the use of external scripts to generate text; monitor
your EVE skill queue, view email subject lines, monitor weather etc etc

_Usage_

Mousewheel over the clock allows you to set and alter an alarm timout in 5
minute increments, useful for pizzas and such.
